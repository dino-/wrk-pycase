# wrk-pycase


## Synopsis

A case expression module (Python3)


## Description

There is no case or switch statement in Python and the common practice is to
use if/elif/else to achieve this control flow.

The Python if/elif/else statement suffers from similar problems as in other
languages. Namely, that it's a statement, not an expression, and doesn't
evaluate to a value. This project is an attempt to write a case module with a
case function. And to compare these methods with each other.
